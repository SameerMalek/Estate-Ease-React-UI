# What problem it solves
Estate-Ease addresses the complexity and inefficiency often associated with property searches. By providing a clean and intuitive interface, users can easily find and explore properties, reducing the time and effort required in the process.

# How I built it
I built the frontend of this project using HTML, SCSS, React.js, and several other technologies and libraries:

1. HTML & SCSS: For creating responsive and visually appealing designs.
2. React.js: Utilized for building dynamic user interfaces. Implemented key hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useNavigate for state management and navigation.
3. Figma: Used for designing the custom background image for the homepage.
4. React-Router DOM: For seamless navigation and routing within the application.
5. React Leaflet Map Library: Integrated to provide an interactive map component for property locations.
6. Responsive Design: Ensured optimal user experience across various devices using SCSS.
# Steps:
- Initial Setup: Started with setting up a React.js environment.
- Design: Created the design for the homepage and other pages using Figma and implemented it with SCSS.
- Routing: Implemented routing using React-Router DOM for smooth navigation.
- State Management: Managed state using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useNavigate) and integrated Zustand for advanced state management.
- Map Integration: Added interactive map functionality using the React Leaflet Map Library.
- Authentication: Integrated authentication flow using JWT and React Context API for managing user sessions.
